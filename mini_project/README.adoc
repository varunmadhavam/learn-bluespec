= BSV Training Mini Project

This mini project is meant to challenge the students to build a
significant piece of logic using concepts covered in the BSV
training. The `src_BSV` directory contains the starting source
file and this file describes the system being built.

== A Squence Detector

The Sequence Detector receives a command on its `request` method
and responds with the answer on its `response` method. In addition
the module has a `Client` interface with which it accesses memory.

The memory serves 256-bits per read. It is initialized using a hex
file which is in this directory. Copy the hex file over to the
directory from which you will be simulating.

A complete setup is provided as a starting point. 

== Compilation and Building

Copy this directory (and subdirs) to `BSV_Training/Example_Programs/`
Build this project just as you would build any other worked
example.
